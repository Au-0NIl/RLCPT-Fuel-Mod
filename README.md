## About

**RLCPT-Fuel-Mod** was my first ever public project – a basic fuel consumption system made for RLCPT!  
When I started, I had no clue how any of this stuff worked. I’m not a coding expert, and I basically just threw together what made sense to me.

But hey, it kinda worked!

## Why?

I wanted a way to simulate fuel usage in RLCPT, so I made my own little E2 code. Even if it’s not perfect (or realistic), it gave the game a new layer of immersion for me.

## Contribute / Feedback

If you somehow found this and want to suggest improvements or help out, feel free to open an issue or fork it. I'm always happy to hear advice or learn something new, even if I'm not actively coding this anymore.

Thanks for checking this out. It may be janky, but it was mine.
